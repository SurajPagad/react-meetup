The repo is structured as below:

  - Branch `master` contains only the shell of the application to bootstrap your development. Edit the components located in `src/components` to start hacking!
  - Branch `solved-examples-es6` contains all the solved examples in the recommended latest syntax (ES6+).
  - Branch `solved-examples-es5` is the same, but uses the older ES5 syntax. Use this if you're not familiar with ES6 syntax.
